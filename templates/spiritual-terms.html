      <h2>Spiritual Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>At <strong>The Journey Home</strong>, we honor your privacy as sacred. This space was created with divine intention, and the information you share here is treated with the utmost care, respect, and spiritual integrity.</p>
      <p><strong>What We Collect (With Your Blessing):</strong><br>
      Your name and email, only if you willingly offer it — through contact forms, newsletter sign-ups, or direct messages. Light digital footprints like browser type and page visits may also be collected to understand how souls are connecting with this sacred space.</p>
      <p><strong>Why We Collect It:</strong><br>
      To respond to your inquiries, to expand our offerings, and to send you loving updates — but only if your spirit says yes.</p>
      <p><strong>Security:</strong> Your data is protected with care. While no digital platform is perfect, we honor your privacy as a spiritual covenant.</p>
