        <h2>About Me â€“ The Journey Home</h2>
        <p>This isnâ€™t just a website. Itâ€™s a reflection of my journey â€” the messy, beautiful, painful, and powerful truth of how I came home to myself.</p>

      <p>My journey started at 17. I thought I had it all figured out â€” but I quickly took a detour that lasted nearly 10 years, lost in drug use, toxic relationships, and brushes with the law. I've made mistakes. Some scars I carry are mine, some were handed to me. But each one has shaped me into who I am now.</p>
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/about-journey1.jpg') }}" class="about-image"> class="about-image" alt="Early Journey">

      <p>About five years ago, I got married. I went back to school, built a life, adopted pets, and tried to create something stable. But when my grandmother â€” my Nanny â€” passed away, everything shifted. Her absence left a void no one else could fill. I kept going, tried to keep it together, but eventually the cracks showed. I checked myself into a mental health facility to rest, heal, and face myself.</p>
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/about-journey2.jpg') }}" class="about-image" alt="Marriage Period">

      <p>While I was inside, my marriage ended. My partner moved on. I was devastated and confused â€” I kept saying I just wanted to go "home," not realizing that one day Iâ€™d understand home was never a place, but a return to self.</p>

      <p>I moved back with my family, but it wasnâ€™t the same. Without Nanny, the warmth was gone. Mental illness, addiction recovery, and the weight of suicidal thoughts donâ€™t make you easy to understand â€” especially when you're expected to be "normal" right away. I was hurting, but I was told to go back to work. I got scammed out of money I desperately needed. And when I finally got my first car, things at home got worse. Curfews. Rules. Tension. They said my dog had to go. I dropped out of school. And eventually, I had to leave.</p>
      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/about-journey4.jpg') }}" class="about-image" alt="Spiritual Moment">

      <p>I was supposed to get my own place. I had a job lined up with Google. But that fell through too. Suddenly, I was homeless. No job. No stable home. Nothing â€” except my car, my dog, and my will to keep going.</p>

      <p>I traveled from state to state, looking for something â€” or maybe just trying to lose what I was. But even in the darkest moments, I was never truly alone. I see that now. I give thanks to the Most High, my ancestors, my spirit team, my angels, archangels â€” and even my shadow self. They carried me.</p>

      <p>I wasnâ€™t chasing material things â€” I was chasing my soul.</p>

      <p>Now, Iâ€™m back in my home state. Still homeless. Still fighting. But something inside me has changed. Iâ€™ve grown. Iâ€™ve forgiven. Iâ€™ve made peace with my past and everyone in it â€” including myself. I donâ€™t chase 9-to-5s anymore. I chase purpose. Passion. Creativity. Freedom.</p>

      <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/about-journey5.jpg') }}" class="about-image" alt="Rising in Power">

      <p>I may not have the traditional credentials, but I have something more valuable: vision, resilience, and faith. Iâ€™m building apps. Games. Tools for transformation. My company, StancilsDev (SDev), is more than business â€” itâ€™s my offering to the world.</p>

      <p>They say I was alone on this journey home â€” but I was never truly alone. I had my fur daughter. My spirit guides. My ancestors. The Most High. And now, I have you â€” witnessing my return.</p>

      <p><strong>Welcome to The Journey Home.</strong></p>
